I started dancing in college, "urban dance" as it's now called. At the time it was "hip hop dance" but has since taken new meaning as the style encorporates so many genres of music and movement. 

As a dancer that does urban dance, it is critical to learn foundational styles. You can't begin to explore your body and develop a vocabulary of movement without building a foundation in those styles, such as popping, locking, housing, and waacking to name a few. 

A big part of the culture of foundational styles is what is called cyphering. You may have seen this before: a group of people stand around in a circle and people take turns moving to the middle of the circle and dancing however they choose. If this sounds terrifying to you, it's because it is.
